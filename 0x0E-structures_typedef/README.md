Structures are complex data structures that can hold different kinds of data items in one; An example of a real life structure is a person. He can have a name, has an age value (defined ad char and int respectively), height as a float and so on. Typedefs are mostly usually used for the creation of an additional name for another data_type, aro to also provide *specific* descriptive names for integer data_types of varying sizes.
